# Advanced Contact Management System (Java) 📞

A robust console-based application built during my Java 1 course to manage contacts with advanced logic and data integrity.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights:
- **Smart Data Structure:** Uses 2D Arrays to manage names linked with multiple phone numbers.
- **Data Integrity:** Implemented logic to prevent duplicate phone numbers.
- **Advanced Deletion:** Option to delete by Name or specific Phone number.
- **Pro Search Algorithm (Fuzzy Matching):**
  - Ignores Case Sensitivity.
  - **Vowel-Stripping:** A custom search logic that removes vowels (a, e, i, o, u) during comparison to improve matching accuracy.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Relevance
As a Cybersecurity student, building this helped me master data structures and input handling, which are essential for **Secure Coding** and **AppSec**.
